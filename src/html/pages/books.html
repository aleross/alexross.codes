<h1>Books worth sharing</h1>
<p class="opening">This is a list of books, mostly about programming or science fiction, that have influenced me and I'd like to share with others.</p>
<p>Many of these books helped me become a programmer. I didn't have a formal education in computer science, but the great thing about computers is the wealth of materials available to self-learners.</p>
<p>If you have a book you think I'd enjoy, I'd love to hear about it <a href="">@areteross</a>.</p>
