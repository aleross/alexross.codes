                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I'm a self-taught programmer, and lifelong learner of all things.</p>
                <p>I taught myself to program my sophomore year of college. I started by reading the 5th edition (2006) of O'Reilly's <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596101992.do"><em>Javascript: The Definitive Guide</em></a> cover to cover over a few weeks. It was a sadistic way to start from scratch, but I didn't know any better and was persistent enough to make it through. Afterwards I built my first website (HTML & CSS) for fun, then volunteered to build a CMS (PHP & MySQL) for an on-campus organization, and soon after got my first programming gig as a web developer (Linux, Apache, PHP & MySQL).</p>
                <p>When I helped co-found Enplug in 2012, I was responsible for building our technology as the CTO. I spent two years creating our system architecture and recruiting many incredible engineers onto our team. During this time I worked across all levels of the stack, from server allocation and admin to Java/Android applications on the Enplug client devices, and everything in between.</p>
                <p>In 2014 Enplug was growing and I became our COO to make sure things went smoothly. During this time I became hands-on with each part of our business for several months at a time. Door-to-door small business sales with our sales team. Customer support calls, supply chain management, shipping product with our operations team. Onboarding, communication and events with HR. Advertising, email marketing and blogging with our marketing team.</p>
               <p>I helped create systems, promoted leaders, and wrote automation/LoB software. I had a blast diving deep into so many areas of expertise with such great teammates.</p>

                <h2>Community</h2>
                <p><strong>CTO Forum:</strong> I'm currently 1 of 7 advisors to the <a href="http://lactoforum.org/">LA CTO Forum</a>, the largest organization of CTOs in California (possibly the world!). It's a vibrate invite-only community that conducts monthly meetings and quarterly round tables. In October 2015 I gave a presentation on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AlexRoss14/angularjs-in-production-53533293">AngularJS in Production</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>UCLA VC Fund:</strong> Since 2014 I've been on the investment committee of the <a href="http://www.venturecapital.ucla.edu/">UCLA VC Fund</a>, where I help analyze companies for investment.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I didn't follow a beaten path in formal education. I started by studying business at San Diego State University, and after two years tranferred to UCLA where I majored in Chinese Language 中文 and culture.</p>
               <p>I learned to read, write and speak simplified and traditional Chinese, and I studied most large Southeast Asian cultures and religions in-depth. I translated ancient writings by Confucius, Laozi, Mencius and more. I also took many additional courses in accounting, finance, literature and biology because as a constant learner I wanted to study everything I found interesting.</p>
              <p>I graduated with honors from UCLA and was invited back to talk to hundreds of incoming students alongside the Dean of Humanities, which was a blast.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I spend most of my free time programming. I also love reading science fiction and computer science <a href="/books">books</a>. I invest in my health to give myself the best chances of living a long life, so I get outside as much as I can: distance & trail running, hiking, and adventuring. I used to love video games, but programming has, for the most part, supplanted them in my life. I mostly listen to classical, rock, and electronic music. My favorite coding music is Lindsey Stirling and Glitchmob.</p>
